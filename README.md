## üìå Overview
**PhishGuard** is a browser extension that provides **two-layer protection** against phishing attacks:

1. **URL-Level Detection** ‚Äì Fast ML classification of URLs using a **stacking ensemble** (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost ‚Üí Logistic Regression meta-model) trained on the **PhiUSIIL Phishing URL** dataset.  
2. **Webpage-Level Detection** ‚Äì Scrapes webpage content and analyzes it with an LLM (Mistral via Ollama) plus heuristic signals (pop-ups, ads, suspicious elements). The **final risk** is a weighted combination of the LLM score and heuristic score.

This two-tier approach verifies both the link and the actual page before flagging a site as phishing.
